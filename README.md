Jump and link to named callouts across your notes. Fuzzily searches callout names.

Planned improvements:
- Better jumping by giving the callout an id first. 
- Settings to customize the behavior including how link names are generated.
- Searching within the callout content.
- Filtering by callout type

Acknowledgements: The code of the similar plugins [Copy Block Link](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-copy-block-link) and [Blockreffer](https://github.com/tyler-dot-earth/obsidian-blockreffer) helped me learn how to develop plugins for Obsidian.
